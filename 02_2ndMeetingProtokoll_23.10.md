Protocol
---
~~~
Start at 16:00 with some communication issues and a work issue we had to start in reduced size
We welcome Sofia on board of our team!

We lay out difficulties in our original approach, and conclude another plan of action has to be realized.
Namely the layout of thasks does not really make any sense.
We discussed a little about our already found maybe relevant literature and concluded, that we will provide a Google Docs document to summerize our literature.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DqwzcUtqfcb6oJ3nlELay1ZPu1mTOTLlqqiocF1R7A8/edit?usp=sharing

We also came to the conclusion, that we should categorize and sort our literature. This is possible in Zotero through folders.

As we have a new teammeber who is not yet integrated to github or zotero, we could not go any much further.

A new meeting has been called. At the moment it is set thursday 30.10 after 17:00.

Also not everyone has Access to Github and Zotero yet.
